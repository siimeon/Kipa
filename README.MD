# Kisapalvelu [KIPA](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tupa2/)

This project is fork of [KIPA](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tupa2/).
Scouting Skill contests result calculation software.

#### Base of my fork can be found from legacy branch. I have not been part of orginal development team and I do not support this project.

# Reason for this project

This project is for my curiosity about KIPA and Django. This project aims to study how Django web app works and maybe do some UI updates to KIPA.

# Requirements

KIPA is Django app and it can be run on any platform that supports correct version of Django

Original KIPA (legacy branch)  can be run by using Django 1.3 witch is out of support

My fork of KIPA (master branch) can be run by using Django 1.4 LTS witch is still in extended support.
